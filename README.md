# sqlalchemy-challenge

I had a pretty difficult time with this at first, but doing it made me start to understand sqlalchemy and flask way more. By the end I felt pretty confident in what I was doing.

Also, and maybe I shouldn't be telling on myself with this, but I didn't find anywhere where I had to join the station and measurement tables, despite what the hints said. The questions about active stations talked only in terms of station id, which the measurement table also has. In fact I don't think it ever calls for station names at all, though I did include them in my station flask route. I believe the way the challenge is written, you don't need to touch the station table at all.

But yeah, overall, I think it went well, and I hope you agree as you grade this!
